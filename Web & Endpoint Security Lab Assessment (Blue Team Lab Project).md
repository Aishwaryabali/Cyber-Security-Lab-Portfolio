Web & Endpoint Security Lab Assessment (Blue Team Lab Project)

 📌 Overview
This project focuses on web application vulnerability testing and endpoint security monitoring within a controlled lab environment. The objective was to detect OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and monitor Windows endpoint activity.

 🛠 Tools Used
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- Kali Linux
- Burp Suite
- OWASP ZAP
- Nikto
- Gobuster
- Windows Event Viewer
- Sysmon
- Splunk
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- OWASP Top 10

 🔍 Methodology

 Web Application Testing
1. Performed SQL Injection testing.
2. Conducted Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) testing.
3. Tested for CSRF vulnerabilities.
4. Enumerated hidden directories and endpoints.
5. Scanned for server misconfigurations using Nikto.

 Endpoint Security Monitoring
1. Collected Windows event logs.
2. Monitored failed login attempts.
3. Detected abnormal login times.
4. Simulated SOC alerts using Splunk dashboards.
5. Mapped suspicious activity to MITRE ATT&CK.

 🔎 Key Findings
- Identified SQL Injection vulnerability in test environment.
- Detected reflected XSS vulnerability.
- Observed brute-force login attempts in event logs.
- Classified vulnerabilities based on severity.

 📊 Risk Assessment Approach
- OWASP Top 10 mapping
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Risk-based mitigation documentation

 🎯 Resume Highlights
- Conducted web application and endpoint security assessment.
- Identified OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- Simulated SOC monitoring and incident detection.
