 Enterprise Network Security Assessment (Red Team Lab Project)

 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a full-scope lab-based network security assessment. 
The objective was to perform reconnaissance, service enumeration, vulnerability identification, and traffic analysis within a controlled lab environment.

 🛠 Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Nmap
- Wireshark / Tshark
- Netdiscover
- Nikto
- Gobuster
- Enum4linux
- CVSS Risk Scoring
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework

 🔍 Methodology

1. Performed host discovery using ARP/ICMP sweep.
2. Conducted TCP port scanning and service/version detection using Nmap.
3. Executed vulnerability scans using Nmap NSE scripts.
4. Enumerated FTP, SMB, and HTTP services.
5. Captured and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark.
6. Identified misconfigured services and potential vulnerabilities.
7. Classified risks using CVSS scoring.
8. Mapped findings to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
9. Documented mitigation recommendations.

 🔎 Key Findings
- Identified open ports exposing unnecessary services.
- Detected outdated service versions with potential vulnerabilities.
- Observed suspicious traffic patterns in packet analysis.
- Classified high-risk findings based on severity.

 📊 Risk Assessment Approach
- CVSS-based risk prioritization
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping for attack techniques
- Remediation strategy documentation

 🎯 Resume Highlights
- Conducted enterprise-grade lab network security assessment.
- Performed reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and traffic analysis.
- Produced structured risk report with mitigation strategies.
